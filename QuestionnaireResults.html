    <!-- Introduction -->

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            This report compares 
            <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>$Nick</strong></span> aged <b>$Age</b> who is <b>$Sex</b>
            from <b>$Country</b>  with the standard samples of UK and Ireland in same age group but not gender. We are in the process of accumulating data for Pakistan and once we have enough we will start using those norms. ​ This report estimates the individual's level on each of the five broad personality domains of the Five-Factor Model. The description of each one of the five broad domains is followed by a more detailed description of personality according to the six subdomains that comprise each domain. 
        ​</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            
            Personality traits describe, <b>relative to other people</b>, the frequency or intensity of a person's feelings, thoughts, or behaviors. Possession of a trait is therefore a <b>matter of degree</b>. We might describe two individuals as&nbsp;extraverts, but still see one as more extraverted than the other. This report uses expressions such as "extravert" or "high in extraversion" to describe someone who is likely to be seen by others as relatively extraverted.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The computer program that generates this report classifies you as 
            <b>very low, low, average, high or very high</b> in a trait
            according to whether your score is approximately in the
           <b>lowest 6%, next 24%, middle 40%, next 24%, or highest 6%</b>
            of scores obtained by people of your sex and roughly your age. Your numerical scores are reported and graphed as&nbsp;percentile estimates. For example, a score of "60" means that your level on that trait is estimated to be higher than 60% of persons of your sex and age. Please keep in mind that "low," "average," and "high" scores on a personality test are <b>neither absolutely good nor bad</b>.
        </p>
		
		 <p style="text-align: justify;"> Domain and Facet descriptions are taken from Dr Johnson's original english language web page and are further enhanced with visualizations, automations and t-score calculations. For academics, we have displayed raw scores after calculating it through an algorithm and matched it with standard sample to get t-scores. Domain and Facet scores are categorized into <b>low, average and high based on t-score matching. </b></p>

 
		
		<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to do a <b>personalized and professional in-depth NEO PI R or NEO PI 3 report</b> with a <b>trained professional</b> to go over the report with you, please send an email to minhaaj@gmail.com or use contact section of the website. The full IPIP contains 3,320 items assembled by Dr. Lewis R. Goldberg. The URL for Dr. Goldberg's IPIP is http://ipip.ori.org/ . The IPIP is in the public domain and its items can be freely downloaded from that site. The IPIP-NEO is not equivalent to the commercial inventory on which it is based, the NEO PI-R®, authored by Paul T. Costa, Jr. and Robert R. McCrae. The genuine NEO PI-R® (240 items) is considered by many psychologists to be the best inventory for measuring traits within the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality.  Please let us know of any tehnical problems you might face during the test. Please note that these tests are meant for <b>healthy populations and not for clinical populations</b> with known psychopathologies. If you suspect a psychopathology and want to find more about it, you should taken <b>MMPI -2  (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory)</b>. Please contact us to schedule a session for that. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;"> P.S. Translation and test is purely for <b>educational and self-awareness purposes</b> and collaborators <b>do not claim any responsibility for its use or misuse</b>. Moreover, it cannot be used as the basis for <b>any legal or pharmaceutical decision</b> and publishers of this page do not claim any responsibility should a situation like this arise as a consequence of taking the test. Results of this test should also not be used to pigeonhole and label people and used for social shaming or stereotyping against them. The purpose of the test is to <b>explore oneself and not judge others.</b></p>

 



		
		
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            A particular level on any trait will probably be neutral or irrelevant for a great many activites, be helpful for accomplishing some things, and detrimental for accomplishing other things. As with any personality inventory, scores and descriptions can only<b> approximate an individual's actual personality</b>. High and low score descriptions are usually accurate, but average scores close to the low or high boundaries might misclassify you as only average.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            On each set of six subdomain scales it is somewhat uncommon but certainly possible to score high in some of the subdomains and low in the others. In such cases more attention should be paid to the <b>subdomain scores than to the broad domain score</b>. Questions about the accuracy of your results are best resolved by showing your report to people who know you well.
        As a guideline if facet scores vary widely from domain scores than as a rule facet scores should be taken more seriously because its <b>convergent and discriminant validity</b> is a little higher than domain validity.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Openness to Experience describes a dimension of cognitive style that distinguishes imaginative, creative people from down-to-earth, conventional people. Open people are intellectually curious, appreciative of art, and sensitive to beauty. They tend to be, compared to closed people, more aware of their feelings. They tend to think and act in individualistic and nonconforming ways. Intellectuals typically score high on Openness to Experience; consequently, this factor has also been called Culture or Intellect. Nonetheless, Intellect is probably best regarded as one aspect of openness to experience. Scores on Openness to Experience are only modestly related to years of education and scores on standard intelligent tests.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Another characteristic of the open cognitive style is a facility for thinking in symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete experience. Depending on the individual's specific intellectual abilities, this symbolic cognition may take the form of mathematical, logical, or geometric thinking, artistic and metaphorical use of language, music composition or performance, or one of the many visual or performing arts. People with low scores on openness to experience tend to have narrow, common interests. They prefer the plain, straightforward, and obvious over the complex, ambiguous, and subtle. They may regard the arts and sciences with suspicion, regarding these endeavors as abstruse or of no practical use. Closed people prefer familiarity over novelty; they are conservative and resistant to change.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Openness is often presented as healthier or more mature by psychologists, who are often themselves open to experience. However, open and closed styles of thinking are useful in different environments. The intellectual style of the open person may serve a professor well, but research has shown that closed thinking is related to superior job performance in police work, sales, and a number of service occupations.

            </canvas>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses. Impulses are not inherently bad; occasionally time constraints require a snap decision, and acting on our first impulse can be an effective response. Also, in times of play rather than work, acting spontaneously and impulsively can be fun. Impulsive individuals can be seen by others as colorful, fun-to-be-with, and zany.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Nonetheless, acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of ways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts not only harm other members of society, but also can result in retribution toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another problem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate rewards but undesirable, long-term consequences. Examples include excessive socializing that leads to being fired from one's job, hurling an insult that causes the breakup of an important relationship, or using pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually destroy one's health.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Impulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes a person's effectiveness in significant ways. Acting impulsively disallows contemplating alternative courses of action, some of which would have been wiser than the impulsive choice. Impulsivity also sidetracks people during projects that require organized sequences of steps or stages. Accomplishments of an impulsive person are therefore small, scattered, and inconsistent.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            A hallmark of intelligence, what potentially separates human beings from earlier life forms, is the ability to think about future consequences before acting on an impulse. Intelligent activity involves contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning routes to these goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face of short-lived impulses to the contrary. The idea that intelligence involves impulse control is nicely captured by the term prudence, an alternative label for the Conscientiousness domain. Prudent means both wise and cautious. Persons who score high on the Conscientiousness scale are, in fact, perceived by others as intelligent. The benefits of high conscientiousness are obvious.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Conscientious individuals avoid trouble and achieve high levels of success through purposeful planning and persistence. They are also positively regarded by others as intelligent and reliable. On the negative side, they can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics. Furthermore, extremely conscientious individuals might be regarded as stuffy and boring. Unconscientious people may be criticized for their unreliability, lack of ambition, and failure to stay within the lines, but they will experience many short-lived pleasures and they will never be called stuffy.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Extraversion is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world. Extraverts enjoy being with people, are full of energy, and often experience positive emotions. They tend to be enthusiastic, action-oriented, individuals who are likely to say "Yes!" or "Let's go!" to opportunities for excitement. In groups they like to talk, assert themselves, and draw attention to themselves.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Introverts lack the exuberance, energy, and activity levels of extraverts. They tend to be quiet, low-key, deliberate, and disengaged from the social world. Their lack of social involvement should not be interpreted as shyness or depression; the introvert simply needs less stimulation than an extravert and prefers to be alone. The independence and reserve of the introvert is sometimes mistaken as unfriendliness or arrogance. In reality, an introvert who scores high on the agreeableness dimension will not seek others out but will be quite pleasant when approached.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are therefore considerate, friendly, generous, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with others'. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature. They believe people are basically honest, decent, and trustworthy. Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others. They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and therefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people. Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Agreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining popularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable people. On the other hand, agreeableness is not useful in situations that require tough or absolute objective decisions. Disagreeable people can make excellent scientists, critics, or soldiers.

Low scorers believe that a certain amount of deception in social relationships is necessary. People find it relatively easy to relate to the straightforward high-scorers on this scale. They generally find it more difficult to relate to the unstraightforward low-scorers on this scale. It should be made clear that low scorers are not unprincipled or immoral; they are simply more guarded and less willing to openly reveal the whole truth. Your level of morality is $r_a2.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Freud originally used the term neurosis to describe a condition marked by mental distress, emotional suffering, and an inability to cope effectively with the normal demands of life. He suggested that everyone shows some signs of neurosis, but that we differ in our degree of suffering and our specific symptoms of distress. Today neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative feelings. Those who score high on Neuroticism may experience primarily one specific negative feeling such as anxiety, anger, or depression, but are likely to experience several of these emotions. People high in neuroticism are emotionally reactive.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            They respond emotionally to events that would not affect most people, and their reactions tend to be more intense than normal. They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. Their negative emotional reactions tend to persist for unusually long periods of time, which means they are often in a bad mood. These problems in emotional regulation can diminish a neurotic's ability to think clearly, make decisions, and cope effectively with stress.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            At the other end of the scale, individuals who score low in neuroticism are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive. They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and free from persistent negative feelings. Freedom from negative feelings does not mean that low scorers experience a lot of positive feelings; frequency of positive emotions is a component of the Extraversion domain.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">​
                <strong>Anxiety score $p_n1</strong>. The "fight-or-flight" system of the brain of anxious individuals is too easily and too often engaged. Therefore, people who are high in anxiety often feel like something dangerous is about to happen. They may be afraid of specific situations or be just generally fearful. They feel tense, jittery, and nervous. Persons low in Anxiety are generally calm and fearless. Your level of anxiety is $r_n1.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">​
                <strong>Anger score $p_n2</strong>. Persons who score high in Anger feel enraged when things do not go their way. They are sensitive about being treated fairly and feel resentful and bitter when they feel they are being cheated. This scale measures the tendency to feel angry; whether or not the person expresses annoyance and hostility depends on the individual's level on Agreeableness. Low scorers do not get angry often or easily. Your level of anger is $r_n2.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">​
                <strong>Depression score $p_n3</strong>. This scale measures the tendency to feel sad, dejected, and discouraged. High scorers lack energy and have difficult initiating activities. Low scorers tend to be free from these depressive feelings. Your level of depression is $r_n3.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <strong>​Self-Consciousness score $p_n4</strong> Self-conscious individuals are sensitive about what others think of them. Their concern about rejection and ridicule cause them to feel shy and uncomfortable abound others. They are easily embarrassed and often feel ashamed. Their fears that others will criticize or make fun of them are exaggerated and unrealistic, but their awkwardness and discomfort may make these fears a self-fulfilling prophecy. Low scorers, in contrast, do not suffer from the mistaken impression that everyone is watching and judging them. They do not feel nervous in social situations. Your level or self-consciousness is $r_n4.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">​
                <strong>Immoderation score $p_n5</strong>. Immoderate individuals feel strong cravings and urges that they have difficulty resisting. They tend to be oriented toward short-term pleasures and rewards rather than long- term consequences. Low scorers do not experience strong, irresistible cravings and consequently do not find themselves tempted to overindulge. Your level of immoderation is $r_n5.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <strong>Vulnerability score $p_n6</strong>. High scorers on Vulnerability experience panic, confusion, and helplessness when under pressure or stress. Low scorers feel more poised, confident, and clear-thinking when stressed. Your level of vulnerability is $r_n6.

        <h2><strong>Experimenal Personality Patterns</strong></h2>
		These "pattern types" are based on Hofstee, De Raade, and Goldberg's AB5C model of personality. A person's two most extreme scores (high or low) determined their pattern. These patterns do not take into account average scores (only high and low scores) and hence domain description with average scores should not be relied on when interpreting the pattern. Moreover, not all descriptions apply to all domains and degree of accuracy must be determined by the test taker him/herself.

As young students they were likely to be restless and unable to concentrate in the classroom, and therefore performed poorly. As adults they are therefore regarded as rough and uncouth as well as impulsive. They like thrills, adventure and action and would find working behind a desk to be frustrating and boring. They are described by others as unorthodox, talkative, outgoing, rule-avoiding, quitting, unlearned, unlettered, self-centered, and unreliable.</p>

        <p id="p101"><strong>Pattern 10.1 SENSITIVE TYPE (High N, High O)</p></strong>
        <p>Sensitive types are very bright but emotionally sensitive. They pay attention to, and are strongly affected by, things that happen in the world around them.

        <p id="p102"><strong>Pattern 10.2 MUDDLED TYPE (High N, Low O) </p></strong>
        <p>Muddled types tend to be anxious about things that lie beyond their limited scope of understanding.

        <p id="p103"><strong>Pattern 10.3 CLEAR-THINKING TYPE (Low N, High O)</p></strong>
        <p>Clear-thinking types are well-adjusted, intelligent individuals. They approach problems in a nonplused, matter-of-fact way, and feel confident about their ability to solve problems.

        <p id="p104"><strong>Pattern 10.4 DOWN-TO-EARTH TYPE (Low N, Low O)</p></strong>
        <p>Down-To-Earth types avoid anxiety by not thinking and reflecting on things very often. They focus on what is happening in their own local area, and adhere to the values and ways of thinking that are typical for their locality. Their neighbors probably regard them as down-to-earth and full of common sense, but outside of their local area they may be regarded as unreflective, unsophisticated, imperceptive, and provincial.</p>
